				<p><b>Church of the Broken God</b>, abbreviated and also known as <b>CBG</b>, is a neutral-hostile techno-religious cult and Group of Interest.</p>
				
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                 The Church of the Broken God is a widespread techno-religious cult that worships Mekhane, a deity believed to have been a great mechanical being shattered in ancient times. Its followers see the organic body as impure and weak, striving instead for perfection through mechanical augmentation and cybernetic enhancement. They believe that by gathering and reconstructing the scattered fragments of their god, often taking the form of anomalous machinery, they can restore Mekhane to wholeness and bring about a new age of order and perfection. Often in opposition to other anomalous groups, particularly the Sarkic cults who revere flesh and mutation, the Church views its mission as both sacred and inevitable.
