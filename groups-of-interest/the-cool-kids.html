				<p><b>The Cool Kids</b>, abbreviated and also known as <b>TCK</b>, is a hostile Class D gang and Group of Interest. With the authorization of the Community Team and the Installation Director, they would launch large-scale Class D riots in an attempt to cause as much chaos as possible and take over the installation.</p>
				
				<h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>
                    TCK was originally formed by a group of disgruntled Class D personnel who discovered the power of unity against the heavily armed MTF units and the watchful eyes of Security staff. The group quickly gained infamy after their first organized riot caused massive disruptions in Installation operations, leading to a massive lockdown and the mobilization of combative Mobile Task Forces that were deployed to stop the riot.
                </p>
				
				<h3>Leadership Structure</h3>
				<p>
				    TCK operates under a hierarchical structure led by their leader, <b>wassup123628</b>. The leader delegates tasks to trusted lieutenants who oversee smaller squads within the gang. Each squad is responsible for different aspects of their operations, including reconnaissance, sabotage, and direct assaults.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>
				➥  The group maintains a strict code of loyalty. Members who betray TCK face severe consequences.
					<br>
				➥  TCK can launch small-scale riots without permission from higher authorities, adding to their unpredictability.
